    <h1 class="post__title">Front Trends 2016 in Warsaw: Day 2</h1>

    <p>Sum&shy;ma&shy;ri&shy;zing the second day pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;ti&shy;ons of the Front Trends 2016 conference in Warsaw. Todays talks were about components, digital afterlife, tiny JS, typography, knitting and frontend tooling. A speakers list can also be found on <a href="https://2016.front-trends.com/speakers/">2016.front-trends.com/speakers/</a>.</p>

<h3>First Class Styles by <a href="http://markdalgleish.com/">Mark Dalgleish</a></h3>
<p>The first talk was very technical, but on an abstract level. Todays tooling handles HTML, Images, JS, CSS seperately (seperate tasks in Grunt or Gulp), and the con&shy;nec&shy;tei&shy;on between them has to be maintained by the developer (by using the same names e.g.). It would be better to have everything which belongs to one component in one place (including CSS which might be written in JS and served inline). Another hot thing: server-side rendering of the HTML. (sic!)</p>
<p>My instant reaction: <em>WTF?</em> This is wrong on so many levels! But Mark presented good arguments (the strongest: it works in production on a big app) that I will take some time reading his blog posts.</p>

<h3>Our eternal digital afterlife by <a href="https://twitter.com/albertatrebla">Alberta Soranzo</a></h3>
<p>Peoples social media profiles are still available when they pass away. Alberta Soranzo explained what tools and strategies (not yet dead) people and their relatives can do. Very moving and widespread talk.</p>

<h3>Demo Reel &amp; Tiny JavaSCript by <a href="http://www.p01.org/">Mathieu Henry</a></h3>
<p>The creative coder and code golfer did exactly this: vanilla JS coding of a cool vi&shy;sua&shy;liza&shy;t&shy;i&shy;on with sound in just a few lines. First some dirty tricks, then some jaw&shy;drop&shy;ping live coding.</p>

<h3>Syntax Highlight Everything by <a href="https://twitter.com/kennethormandy">Kenneth Ormandy</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing is designed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Starting with features of syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing and code fonts, Kenneth explains some ty&shy;po&shy;gra&shy;phic features (kerning, ligatures, case-sensitive fonts, small caps) and how to use them correctly in your CSS. The best part: you can just copy and use it from <a href="http://utility-opentype.kennethormandy.com/">utility-opentype.ken&shy;net&shy;hor&shy;man&shy;dy.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Taking over the web platform with Angular 2 by <a href="https://twitter.com/toddmotto">Todd Motto</a></h3>
<p>A walk through Angular 2 ar&shy;chi&shy;tec&shy;tu&shy;re, (web) components, dataflow.</p>
<h3>Panel Discussion: The State of Front-End Tooling</h3>
<p><em>It is hard to cover a discussion, so I just post a few questions to think about.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Today, is it harder to get into FE De&shy;ve&shy;lop&shy;ment than ten years ago?</li>
<li>What features do you think are still missing on the web platform?</li>
<li>In our industry: How much is healthy com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;ti&shy;on, how much is fighting/arguing?</li>
<li>How important is it for companies to build own tools? Or to use available solutions?</li>
<li>What do you think about the re&shy;s&shy;pon&shy;si&shy;bi&shy;li&shy;ties of big companies using Open Source software, and the authors which suddenly have a huge company depending on them?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>...and a few thoughts from the panel:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Even for small things, we need a packet manager and a build process. You can still open and save a text file, reload the browser, and see results. But what you find on the web is more in&shy;ti&shy;mi&shy;da&shy;ting than in the past.</li>
<li>Today, (some!) people learn Angular but downt know what the script-Tag does ona a page.</li>
<li>You constantly have to fight holy wars over which tools to use.</li>
<li>Rewriting just for the sake is a good thing on your own projects/money. But on clients cost there should be a business value which justifies re&shy;fac&shy;to&shy;ring.</li>
</ul>
