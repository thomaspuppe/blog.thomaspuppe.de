<p>The first talk was very technical, but on an abstract level. Todays tooling handles HTML, Images, JS, CSS seperately (seperate tasks in Grunt or Gulp), and the connecteion between them has to be maintained by the developer (by using the same names e.g.). It would be better to have everything which belongs to one component in one place (including CSS which might be written in JS and served inline). Another hot thing: server-side rendering of the HTML. (sic!)</p>
<p>My instant reaction: <em>WTF?</em> This is wrong on so many levels! But Mark presented good arguments (the strongest: it works in production on a big app) that I will take some time reading his blog posts.</p>

<p>The creative coder and code golfer did exactly this: vanilla JS coding of a cool visualization with sound in just a few lines. First some dirty tricks, then some jawdropping live coding.</p>

<p>Syntax highlighting is designed.</p>

<p>Starting with features of syntax highlighting and code fonts, Kenneth explains some typographic features (kerning, ligatures, case-sensitive fonts, small caps) and how to use them correctly in your CSS. The best part: you can just copy and use it from <a href="http://utility-opentype.kennethormandy.com/">utility-opentype.kennethormandy.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="panel-discussion-the-state-of-front-end-tooling">Panel Discussion: The State of Front-End Tooling</h2>
<p><em>It is hard to cover a discussion, so I just post a few questions to think about.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Today, is it harder to get into FE Development than ten years ago?</li>
<li>What features do you think are still missing on the web platform?</li>
<li>In our industry: How much is healthy competition, how much is fighting/arguing?</li>
<li>How important is it for companies to build own tools? Or to use available solutions?</li>
<li>What do you think about the responsibilities of big companies using Open Source software, and the authors which suddenly have a huge company depending on them?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>...and a few thoughts from the panel:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Even for small things, we need a packet manager and a build process. You can still open and save a text file, reload the browser, and see results. But what you find on the web is more intimidating than in the past.</li>
<li>Today, (some!) people learn Angular but downt know what the script-Tag does ona a page.</li>
<li>You constantly have to fight holy wars over which tools to use.</li>
<li>Rewriting just for the sake is a good thing on your own projects/money. But on clients cost there should be a business value which justifies refactoring.</li>
</ul>
