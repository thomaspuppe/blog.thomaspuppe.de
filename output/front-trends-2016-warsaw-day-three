<p>People long for connection with others. By creating emotional UX and positive experience, you create trust and users will come back.</p>
<p>As a user, you recognize if an interface (the people behind it) care for you, or simply don&#39;t care. For example, friends don&#39;t let friends make mistakes.</p>
<p>Even little UI eastereggs can be incredibly delightful. But don&#39;t get creepy. Nobody likes stalker interfaces.</p>

<h2 id="can-t-you-make-it-more-like-bootstrap-by-alice-bartlett">Can&#39;t you make it more like Bootstrap? by <a href="http://alicebartlett.co.uk/">Alice Bartlett</a></h2>
<p>Subtitle: &quot;Considerations for building front end systems&quot;. Alice leads a team whose aim is to unify and DRY frontend work at the Financial Times (project &quot;Origami&quot;.</p>
<p>On the different FT branded websites, there are a lot of things which have been implemented differently, even on atomic scale (4 implementations of a close button which looks the same, 3 different Twitter icons).</p>
<p>First step was to use components to keep HTML, CSS, JS for one thing in one place (this seems to be a hot topic this year).</p>
<p>The websites also have different tooling, which should be unified so all websites (implemented in different languages) can use the same components.</p>
<p>You can move the JS to bower packages, for example. But for (customizable) HTML templates or CSS ths is more complicated. So they implemented a build service that &quot;everyone&quot; can use to request Origamis CSS, JS and HTML. People liked using it, but the documentation was not good. -&gt; I wish it was more like bootstrap.</p>
<p>And: they created a documentation styleguide(!), whcih includes a communication plan for new releases, incident reports, ...</p>

<p>Great talk about what seems to be expected from &quot;good programmers&quot; today, and what really is.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t need to know everything, finding a niche is cool. This is not a test. Real developers use resources wisely. Code has not to be perfect or even correct on the first try (or at all). Learn from mistakes. Show your work, not only your finished and polishes products. Encourage each other. We don&#39;t have to code all the day and everyday. Being a developer does not have to kill your hobbies (or parentship).</p>
