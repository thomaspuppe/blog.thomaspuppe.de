<h3>Exploring the Universal Library by <a href="http://treesmovethemost.com/">Szymon Kalinski</a></h3>
<p>Szymon showed some work he had done. It looked <a href="http://treesmovethemost.com/">really cool</a>, but honestly I don't know what he wanted to tell us ;-)</p>
<h3>Pixel Bonding by <a href="http://diaryofawebsite.com/">Tammie Lister</a></h3>
<p>People long for connection with others. By creating emotional UX and positive experience, you create trust and users will come back.</p>
<p>As a user, you recognize if an interface (the people behind it) care for you, or simply don't care. For example, friends don't let friends make mistakes.</p>
<p>Even little UI eastereggs can be incredibly delightful. But don't get creepy. Nobody likes stalker interfaces.</p>

<h3>Can't you make it more like Bootstrap? by <a href="http://alicebartlett.co.uk/">Alice Bartlett</a></h3>
<p>Subtitle: "Con&shy;side&shy;ra&shy;ti&shy;ons for building front end systems". Alice leads a team whose aim is to unify and DRY frontend work at the Financial Times (project "Origami".</p>
<p>On the different FT branded websites, there are a lot of things which have been im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ted dif&shy;fer&shy;ent&shy;ly, even on atomic scale (4 im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;ti&shy;ons of a close button which looks the same, 3 different Twitter icons).</p>
<p>First step was to use components to keep HTML, CSS, JS for one thing in one place (this seems to be a hot topic this year).</p>
<p>The websites also have different tooling, which should be unified so all websites (im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ted in different languages) can use the same components.</p>
<p>You can move the JS to bower packages, for example. But for (cust&shy;o&shy;miz&shy;able) HTML templates or CSS ths is more com&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;ted. So they im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ted a build service that "everyone" can use to request Origamis CSS, JS and HTML. People liked using it, but the do&shy;cu&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;ti&shy;on was not good. -&gt; I wish it was more like bootstrap.</p>
<p>And: they created a do&shy;cu&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;ti&shy;on styleguide(!), whcih includes a com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;ti&shy;on plan for new releases, incident reports, ...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do&shy;cu&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;ti&shy;on is not com&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;ted. It is just hard.</p>

<p>The Guardian's Native app caches articles offline, to provide content even if the user (or the servers) are offline. The website is not available offline. Oliver built a prototype for an offline page in less than a day! And provided a detailes step-by-step walkth&shy;rough on how it works.</p>

<h3>The Myth of the "Real JavaScript Pro&shy;gram&shy;mer" by <a href="http://brennaobrien.com/">Brenna O'Brian</a></h3>
<p>Great talk about what seems to be expected from "good pro&shy;gramm&shy;er&shy;s" today, and what really is.</p>
<p>We don't need to know everything, finding a niche is cool. This is not a test. Real developers use resources wisely. Code has not to be perfect or even correct on the first try (or at all). Learn from mistakes. Show your work, not only your finished and polishes products. Encourage each other. We don't have to code all the day and everyday. Being a developer does not have to kill your hobbies (or parentship).</p>
